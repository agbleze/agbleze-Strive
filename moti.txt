<h1> Why I want to learn web development at <a href "https://strive.school/optin32129918#" 
target = "_blank">Strive</a> </h1>
<br>
<h2> Learn new skills to solve societal problem </h2>

<p style="font-family:cambria; font-size:120%"> My main motivation to learn web development and upgrade further to software engineering is to acquire the required 
skills to <b>set-up my consultancy</b> and and <b>become a digital social entrepreneur</b>. Web development skills provides a fertile 
ground for <b>self-employment</b> and this is my prime reason for taking the necessary step in that direction. Some of the 
projects I aim to develop are already underway but my current skills level is inadequate to complete them hence the <ins><strong>needed 
support from Strive</ins></strong>.
</p>
<br>
<h2>Employment with dignity</h2>
<p style="font-family:cambria; font-size:120%">The employment avenue that web development and software engineering creates is unlike others that I have engaged in. 
It offers <strong>flexibility</strong> and <ins>tap into an individual's creativity which I would love to be part of my professional 
environment.</ins> I would love to code as a job to enjoy the <b>dignity</b> that comes with like.
</p>

<br>
<h2>You are paid what you deserve</h2>
<p style="font-family:cambria; font-size:120%">
Another reason for my decision to learn web development is base on the reward and future potentials for that to even increase. 
Within the tech industry, web developers are not only among the top paid but also have steady demand for their skills. 
Given that, <em>I am interested in job security that blends well with good pay, working on different projects and diversity,</em> 
web development serves my ideal interest.
</p>
<br>
<h2>Well-tailored course structure, skills and toolset</h2>
<p style="font-family:cambria; font-size:120%">
Upon reviewing the <a href "https://strive.school/optin32129918#" target = "_blank">course structure</a> on Strive website and requirements by most employers, I realized that 
Strive offers a unique plethora of skills that are well-matched to what employers demand. This leaves me in no doubt to 
prefer Strive to other schools. Meeting my peculiar needs is the fact that not only skills such as coding in 
Javascript, using <b><abbr title= "Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr></b> and <b><abbr title = "Cascading Style Sheets"
>CSS </abbr></b> are taught but also state of the art tools such as React, Node.js and mongoDB among others. This creates
room for me to specialize while also gaining the general skills of others.
</p>
<br>
<h2>Ideal payment structure</h2>
<p style="font-family:cambria; font-size:120%">
What really grabs my attention is the unique payment structure which is well suited for me. The flexibility of having to pay
after securing a job indicates the high level of trust and guarantee that is offered and the greater opportunity of focusing
on the course without worrying about exorbitant initial fees. This is a perfect deal that can leverage my full concentration for the study.
</p>
<br>

<h2>Mode of tutelage and time span of the course</h2>
<p style="font-family:cambria; font-size:120%">
 The option of online learning provided by Strive gives me the opportunity of coding from the comfort of my home &#128151.
 Thus, no time is waste in travelling and associate cost of relocating are absent making the course cost effective &#128525. 
 Moreover, the time span of the course will allow me to reap the fruit of my new skills in the short-term.
